# Django Project Template

This is a fully set up Django project template that includes a project-level `urls.py` file connected with an app-level `urls.py` file. It also provides static and templates folders, and is already connected with the `settings.py` file.

Please make sure you have a virtual environment set up before running this project. Here are the steps to get started:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajit-singha-sisir/Django-Project-Setup-Template.git
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The development server will start at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes the following files and folders:

- `Project/`: The root directory of the Django project.
  - `manage.py`: The Django management script.
  - `Project/`: The project package directory.
    - `settings.py`: The project settings file.
    - `urls.py`: The project-level URL configuration.
    - `wsgi.py`: The WSGI application entry point.
- `app1/`: The Django app directory.
  - `urls.py`: The app-level URL configuration.
  - `views.py`: The app's views file.
  - `static/`: Folder for static files (CSS, JS, etc.).
  - `templates/`: Folder for HTML templates.

## Usage

- Modify the project-level `urls.py` file to include your app's URLs and views.
- Customize the app's views in the `views.py` file to handle the desired logic.
- Place your static files in the `static/` folder and HTML templates in the `templates/` folder.
- Run the development server using `python manage.py runserver`.

Remember to activate your virtual environment (`source env/bin/activate` for Linux/Mac or `env\Scripts\activate` for Windows) before running the project.
